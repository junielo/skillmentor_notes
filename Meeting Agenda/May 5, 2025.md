**Concern To:** Zeno
**Status:** Checking
**Remark:** Just make the Role and CL hardcoded .

Zeno's Inquiries:
1. Select List page items for Role, CL, Action as well as the Generate buttons have no functionalities yet. To confirm functions and values for these.
	1. For the Role and CL, it would be better to create a table for these 2 definition and in the candidate table add an additional column for ROLE_ID and CL_ID for filtering if either Role and CL filter was selected.
	2. Action is I think an APEX built-in feature.
	3. We will remove the Generate button.
2. Saan po nakukuha ang value for Career Level kapag nag a add ng User sa SkillMentor, di ko mahanap sa mga existing tables sa skillmentor schema
	1. Create table for Role and CL except for the Action because I think this a built-in feature of APEX.
	2. Role
		1. ID: Primary
		2. NAME: Varchar
		3. REMARK: Text
	3. CL
		1. ID: Primary
		2. NAME: Varchar
		3. REMARK: Text
3. Ano ano po ang mga options na lalabas pagka click ng mga buttons under Actions column, pati po sa mga side buttons sa right pane ng page?
