Upon review submission.
How do we recognize what skill was being reviewed? We will retrieve it through the comment review using GenAI Skill Extraction, that means we need to notify the reviewer to include the skills of the candidate on the review.

Process Flow:
1. Call this endpoint.
2. Receive the comment review. 
3. Make a prompt instruction for GPT to extract the skills from the comment review.
4. Return the extracted skills.
