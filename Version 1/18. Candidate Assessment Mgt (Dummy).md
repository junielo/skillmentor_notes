*Important!* To display this page with data, on Acquired Skills retrieve from the table SM_ASSESSMENT_RESULT. For the adjacent skills make a dummy data in APEX just for now.

**Assessment Column** = Will use the column FINAL_SCORE from SM_ASSESSMENT_RESULT table but if there is no value yet, show 'Unavailable' as a value.

**Demand Column** = To get this value we can follow this process.
1. Example for the skill PL/SQL, we can lookup the table SM_DEMAND_SKILLS and gather all the demands that also required this skill.
2. Sum up the value from POSTING column.
3. Show value to UI.

### Tables
SM_ASSESSMENT_RESULT = Where the result or the status of the skill assessment for the candidate.
SM_SKILL_MASTER = To join in SM_ASSESSMENT_RESULT table to get the skill name. 
SM_DEMAND_SKILLS = For demand lookup and posting value summation.
