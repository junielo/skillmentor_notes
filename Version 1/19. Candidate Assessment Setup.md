# Modal

### Pointers
Hard code for now the total number of question to 10 items with two empty input fields one for the question and the other for the complete correct answer.
Every candidate has unique skill assessment so even though there is already assessment for PL/SQL for this candidate, we still have to create for the others.
Generate button will generate or auto fill all the question and answer input fields by sending an API request to get the data.
Refresh button will generate or auto fill the specific question and answer input field by sending an API request to get the data.
Remove button is just clearing out value of specific question and answer input field not the input fields itself.
### Navigation
1. From Candidate Management page, click a name from the list.
